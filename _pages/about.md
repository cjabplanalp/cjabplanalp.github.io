I am a Senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison expected to graduate Spring 2024. I double major in Data Science and Information Science, and I am receiving a certificate in Computer Science. My hometown is Evanston, Illinois, home to Northwestern University and just north of the City of Chicago.

Entering college, I planned to study Biochemistry. When I found it wasn't for me, I took a Computer Science course and immediately fell in love with coding without having any prior experience with it. 

Since then, I've explored breadths of the field through coursework and study, and found that Data Science allows me to combine facets of myself through code: meticulous organization, efficiency, and creation. After I declared Data Science, I became passionate about the relationship between people and code, pushing me to also declare Information Science to further investigate the relationship between the two.

# Languages

I have extensive experience with Python, and also experience with R, Java, MySQL, bash scripts, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Within Python, I further have experience deploying big data systems such as PySpark, Cassandra/CQL, Apache Hadoop/HDFS, and Apache Kafka with Docker. Recently, I've been learning Ruby and Jekyll, which is how this site is powered! 

# Interests

In my free time, I love spending my time outdoors. I like warm weather, and in the warmer months, I enjoy being by bodies of water to swim or finding a new basketball court to play with a group of friends. When it's colder, I love trying new restaurants, playing Rocket League, and walking on the ice of Lake Mendota in Madison.
